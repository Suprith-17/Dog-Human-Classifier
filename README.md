# Dog-Human-Classifier

# 🐶 Dog Breed Classification Project 🐾

## 📖 Overview

In this notebook, you will implement an algorithm that detects whether a user-supplied image contains a dog or a human. If a dog is detected, the algorithm will estimate its breed. If a human is detected, it will suggest the dog breed that resembles them. Let's make this a fun user experience! 🎉

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Make sure to download the required datasets:
   - [Dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip) (extract to `/dog_images`)
   - [Human dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip) (extract to `/lfw`)

2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Use the provided Jupyter notebook to implement the code. Sections marked with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** will need your input! 🔍

## 📝 Steps

### Step 0: Import Datasets
Load the necessary human and dog datasets into the notebook.

### Step 1: Detect Humans
Use OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier to detect human faces in images.

### Step 2: Detect Dogs
Implement functionality to detect dogs using a separate model.

### Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from the ground up to classify dog breeds.

### Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Utilize transfer learning to improve classification accuracy.

### Step 5: Write your Algorithm
Combine the detection and classification models to create a cohesive algorithm.

### Step 6: Test Your Algorithm
Run tests to evaluate the performance of your algorithm.

## 🛠️ Notes

- Make sure to run all code cells before exporting the notebook to HTML. 
- Your final submission should include the notebook and the exported HTML document. 📄

## ❓ Questions

You will find sections titled **'Question X'** where you should provide thorough answers based on your implementation.
